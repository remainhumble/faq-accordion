## Overview

A FAQ accordion is an effective way to display frequently asked questions and answers on your website. It provides a user-friendly way for visitors to find information without overwhelming them with text.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [FAQ accordion using HTML, CSS, JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qnWreynXLU) - Learnt and repeated after most of the work from this video, however I definitely did have to work on the appearance and behaviour myself to closely match the designs downloaded from Front End Mentor site.
- [Why web accessibility matters](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/introduction-to-web-accessibility-mXu-9PHVsd/article/6647781a20fb35b1b61abb4d/read) - A concise overview of accessibility principles and practical guidance for making interactive components (like accordions) keyboard- and screen-reader-friendly, plus links to further learning.
